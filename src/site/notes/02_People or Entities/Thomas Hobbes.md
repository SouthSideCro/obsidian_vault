## üß≠ Summary
**Thomas Hobbes (1588‚Äì1679)** is the central architect of modern political philosophy and the first systematic theorist of sovereignty grounded in human nature rather than divine order. Writing amid the English Civil War, Hobbes sought to rebuild the unity shattered by the [[01_Topics/Crisis of Christendom\|Crisis of Christendom]]. His vision of politics begins from fear, reason, and necessity, culminating in the *Leviathan* ‚Äî an artificial state that guarantees peace by absolute authority. For [[Alan Ryan\|Alan Ryan]], Hobbes completes the realist trajectory begun by [[Niccol√≤ Machiavelli\|Niccol√≤ Machiavelli]]: where Machiavelli secularized politics, Hobbes rationalized it.

## üß© Key Points
- **Historical Context:**  
  - Born in 1588 ‚Äî the year of the Spanish Armada; he joked that ‚Äúfear and I were born twins.‚Äù  
  - Lived through the English Civil War (1642‚Äì1651): a brutal contest over divine right and parliamentary power.  
  - Saw political order collapse amid religious pluralism and rebellion ‚Äî confirming the dangers of divided sovereignty.  

- **Intellectual Influences:**  
  - [[Francis Bacon\|Francis Bacon]]‚Äôs empiricism and scientific method.  
  - [[Ren√© Descartes\|Ren√© Descartes]]‚Äô mechanical philosophy and rational structure of the world.  
  - [[Jean Bodin\|Jean Bodin]]‚Äôs concept of sovereignty ‚Äî refined and absolutized.  

- **Philosophical Project:**  
  - To construct a political science rooted in human passions and reason.  
  - To explain political authority as the product of **fear** (of death) and **rational necessity** (for security).  
  - To justify absolute sovereignty as the logical solution to civil conflict.  

- **Key Concepts:**  
  - *[[01_Topics/State of Nature\|State of Nature]]*: a hypothetical condition of equality and insecurity, where life is ‚Äúsolitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and short.‚Äù  
  - *[[01_Topics/Social Contract\|Social Contract]]*: individuals surrender natural freedom to a sovereign for protection.  
  - *[[01_Topics/Sovereignty\|Sovereignty]]*: absolute, indivisible, and necessary for peace.  
  - *[[01_Topics/Fear and Order\|Fear and Order]]*: fear is not pathology but the foundation of civil obedience.  
  - *[[01_Topics/Necessit√† (Necessity)\|Necessit√† (Necessity)]]*: human behavior follows deterministic laws; politics must respect them.  

- **Major Works:**  
  - *[[03_Sources or Texts/Leviathan\|Leviathan]]* (1651): comprehensive account of human nature, politics, and religion.  
  - *[[De Cive\|De Cive]]* (1642): earlier, more theological version of the same argument.  
  - *[[On the Citizen\|On the Citizen]]* (Latin) and *Behemoth* (posthumous): extensions of his political analysis.  

## üîó Connections
- Follows from [[01_Topics/Crisis of Christendom\|Crisis of Christendom]] and [[01_Topics/The Reformation and the Crisis of Authority\|The Reformation and the Crisis of Authority]] ‚Äî secular solution to religious fragmentation.  
- Develops [[01_Topics/Sovereignty\|Sovereignty]] into a fully rationalized system of absolute authority.  
- Continues the realist thread from [[02_People or Entities/Machiavelli\|Machiavelli]] through [[Jean Bodin\|Jean Bodin]].  
- Integrates with the [[05_Frameworks or Models/Fear‚ÄìOrder‚ÄìSovereignty Framework\|Fear‚ÄìOrder‚ÄìSovereignty Framework]] as the psychological basis of stability.  
- Anticipates modern social contract theory and connects to later thinkers like [[John Locke\|John Locke]] and [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau\|Jean-Jacques Rousseau]].

## üí¨ Reflections or Applications
Hobbes‚Äôs achievement lies in grounding political order in human psychology and rational self-interest rather than divine command. His vision of the sovereign as an artificial unity ‚Äî the *Leviathan* ‚Äî turns politics into a science of necessity. For all its authoritarian appearance, Hobbes‚Äôs theory remains a defense of peace against chaos. In this, he stands as the pivotal thinker who transformed the moral and theological crises of the Reformation into the secular foundations of the modern state.
