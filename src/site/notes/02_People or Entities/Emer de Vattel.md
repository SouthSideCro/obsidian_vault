## 🧭 Summary
**Emer de Vattel (1714–1767)** was the Enlightenment codifier of the *Law of Nations*.  
Building on [[02_People or Entities/Hugo Grotius\|Hugo Grotius]] and [[02_People or Entities/Samuel Pufendorf\|Samuel Pufendorf]], he transformed natural law from philosophical principle into practical diplomatic code.  
His 1758 treatise *[[The Law of Nations (1758)\|The Law of Nations (1758)]]* became the definitive manual for eighteenth- and nineteenth-century statesmen, shaping international relations from Europe to the Americas.  
Vattel secularized natural law into **state morality** — a system of rules for “civilized nations” bound by reason, treaties, and mutual recognition.

## 🧩 Key Points

### ⚖️ Law of Nations as Practical Code
- Defined the *state* as a **moral person**, bound by the same laws of reason as individuals.  
- Distinguished *natural law* (moral obligation) from *voluntary law* (customary rules among states).  
- Affirmed the **sovereign equality of states**, a legacy of [[04_Comparative or Integrated Notes/Grotius - and Westphalia\|Grotius - and Westphalia]].  
- Emphasized *pacta sunt servanda* — the moral duty to honor treaties — as the cornerstone of order.  
- His text provided the first **systematic guide for diplomacy**, peace treaties, and neutrality.  

---

### 🌍 Enlightenment Natural Law
- Combined **rational universalism** (from Grotius and Pufendorf) with **political realism** (from Hobbes).  
- Law must reflect the nature of man *and* the nature of states.  
- This synthesis grounded international law not in divine command but in enlightened reason and mutual interest.  
- His vision marked the **maturation of Modern Natural Law (MNL)** into Enlightenment jurisprudence.  

---

### 💣 Contradictions and Legacy
- Although Vattel proclaimed equality of nations, he limited it to “civilized” peoples.  
- Non-European societies were often excluded or subordinated within this legal order.  
- His *Law of Nations* guided European diplomacy but also justified colonization as “extension of civilization.”  
- The American founders, including Washington and Franklin, cited Vattel as a legal and moral authority in building their republic.

## 🔗 Connections
- Follows directly from [[02_People or Entities/Samuel Pufendorf\|Samuel Pufendorf]] and systematizes the [[01_Topics/Law of Nations (Jus Gentium)\|Law of Nations (Jus Gentium)]].  
- Integrates the dual concept from [[01_Topics/Sovereignty - Internal vs External\|Sovereignty - Internal vs External]].  
- Prefigures modern **international law and humanitarian law**, but also underpins the legal ideology of empire.  
- Leads into [[04_Comparative or Integrated Notes/Locke - Property and Empire\|Locke - Property and Empire]] for the moral-economic dimension of European expansion.

## 💬 Reflections or Applications
Vattel’s genius lay in turning natural law into political common sense.  
He offered Enlightenment Europe a stable moral vocabulary — duty, equality, civilization — that structured diplomacy for centuries.  
Yet the same vocabulary built the moral scaffolding of empire: a world where equality was proclaimed but hierarchy endured.  
Vattel’s legacy is thus the paradox of international law itself — a system built to universalize justice but born inside empire.
