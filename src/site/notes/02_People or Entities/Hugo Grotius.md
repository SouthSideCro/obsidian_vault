## üß≠ Summary
**Hugo Grotius (1583‚Äì1645)**, jurist, philosopher, and diplomat of the Dutch Republic, is often called the *father of international law*.  
Living amid the religious wars of early modern Europe, he sought to establish a universal law of nature and nations that would bind rulers and peoples alike ‚Äî even ‚Äú**etsi Deus non daretur**‚Äù (if God did not exist).  
For Grotius, law arises from **human sociability and reason**, not divine command.  
This shift from theology to reason founded modern jurisprudence, but also justified Dutch imperial power and trade expansion, revealing a deep tension between **humanist universalism** and **colonial realism**.

## üí¨ Reflections or Applications
Grotius embodies the paradox of modern law: it promises universality but arises from empire.  
His rational natural law set the groundwork for international norms ‚Äî equality of states, treaty obligation, just war ‚Äî yet simultaneously empowered European domination overseas.  
In this tension lies the enduring ‚ÄúGrotian problem‚Äù: can a law of nations born from conquest ever truly be universal?  
His legacy endures in the language of the UN Charter, humanitarian law, and modern diplomacy ‚Äî each haunted by his question of whether reason alone can bind power.
