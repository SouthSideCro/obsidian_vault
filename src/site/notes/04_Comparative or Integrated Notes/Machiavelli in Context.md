## ðŸ§­ Summary
Machiavelliâ€™s thought emerges from the upheavals of late fifteenth- and early sixteenth-century Florenceâ€”a city torn between republican experimentation and Medici dominance, and a peninsula ravaged by foreign invasions. His experiences as diplomat and civil servant during the Italian Wars shaped his understanding of politics as unstable, contingent, and governed by necessity. The crises of Florence and Italy convinced him that survival required realism, discipline, and institutional strength rather than moral reform.

## ðŸ§© Key Points
- **Historical Setting:**  
  - Florence after the death of [[Lorenzo deâ€™ Medici\|Lorenzo deâ€™ Medici]] (1492) entered a period of turbulence.  
  - [[Girolamo Savonarola\|Girolamo Savonarola]]â€™s brief theocratic rule (1494â€“1498) revealed the fragility of moralist politics.  
  - The French invasion of Italy (1494) and subsequent wars exposed the weakness of divided city-states.  

- **Machiavelliâ€™s Career:**  
  - Appointed Secretary to the Second Chancery (1498); managed diplomacy, defense, and militia reform.  
  - Advocated for a citizen militia, rejecting mercenary dependence.  
  - Served on missions to France, the Papacy, and Cesare Borgiaâ€™s courtâ€”first-hand studies in power and ambition.  
  - After the Medici restoration (1512), he was dismissed, imprisoned, and torturedâ€”then exiled to his farm near San Casciano.  

- **Intellectual Context:**  
  - Influenced by Renaissance humanism but skeptical of its moral optimism.  
  - Witnessed the decline of civic republicanism and the rise of centralized dynastic power.  
  - Observed the corruption of Church and Papacy under Alexander VI and Julius II.  
  - These experiences grounded his rejection of utopian ideals and his turn toward *[[01_Topics/Political Realism\|Political Realism]]*.  

- **Historical Forces:**  
  - The fragmentation of Italy and domination by France, Spain, and the Holy Roman Empire.  
  - The broader shift toward the modern state system.  
  - [[Alan Ryan\|Alan Ryan]] emphasizes that Machiavelliâ€™s realism reflects both personal disappointment and systemic necessityâ€”the end of the medieval world of politics.

## ðŸ’¬ Reflections or Applications
Machiavelliâ€™s realism cannot be separated from the world he inhabited: a Florence caught between republican ideals and foreign domination. His rejection of idealism reflects a hard-earned recognition of fragility and change. Understanding his historical context turns his apparent cynicism into tragic wisdomâ€”the insight that order arises not from virtue alone, but from the disciplined response to necessity. The crises of Renaissance Italy thus gave birth to the modern science of politics.
