## 🧭 Summary
The rise of European empire in the seventeenth century coincided with the birth of modern international law.  
Thinkers like [[02_People or Entities/Hugo Grotius\|Hugo Grotius]] framed the world as a community of rational and sovereign actors — yet this “universal order” was built on colonial domination.  
Grotius’s *[[01_Topics/Law of Nations (Jus Gentium)\|Law of Nations (Jus Gentium)]]* provided a moral vocabulary for European expansion: *freedom of the seas*, *just wars of commerce*, and *civilized sovereignty*.  
The same ideas that limited war in Europe justified conquest abroad.

## 🧩 Key Points

### ⚓ The Dutch Context
- [[02_People or Entities/Hugo Grotius\|Hugo Grotius]]’s career unfolded amid the Dutch Republic’s commercial expansion and its wars with Portugal and Spain.  
- As lawyer for the **Dutch East India Company (VOC)**, Grotius wrote *[[Mare Liberum (1609)\|Mare Liberum (1609)]]* defending **freedom of the seas** (*mare liberum*) against Iberian monopolies.  
- His arguments sanctified **trade as a natural right**, legitimizing private war in defense of commerce.  
- The VOC thus became a quasi-sovereign actor, waging “just wars” against Asian powers under Grotian principles.

### ⚖️ Dual Faces of Natural Law
| Aspect | Universalist Law | Imperial Practice |
|:--|:--|:--|
| **Principle** | All peoples bound by reason and justice. | “Civilized nations” claim authority to enforce law abroad. |
| **Goal** | Peaceful coexistence among states. | Expansion and domination under legal pretexts. |
| **Instrument** | Treaties, commerce, diplomacy. | Private companies, armed trade, colonization. |
| **Moral Logic** | Equality of sovereigns. | Hierarchy of civilizations. |

Grotius’s universalism thus produced **hierarchical universality** — all are subject to law, but not all are its authors.

### 🧭 Grotius and Colonial War
- By defining just war as defense of rights, Grotius made **commercial self-defense** a legal justification for imperial aggression.  
- The VOC claimed the right to wage war independently against “pirates” or “unjust rulers.”  
- This blurred the line between **state and private sovereignty**, a model later replicated by British and French chartered companies.  
- Colonialism became an extension of natural law: violence wrapped in legality.

### 🌍 The Westphalian Paradox
- The **Treaty of Westphalia (1648)** established equality of European states — but excluded colonized peoples from this system.  
- Within Europe: law, diplomacy, and balance of power.  
- Outside Europe: conquest, conversion, and economic domination.  
- The “international” order was never global — it was **Eurocentric law projected as universal**.

---

### 💡 Philosophical Continuities
- [[John Locke\|John Locke]] built on Grotius to justify property appropriation: labor creates ownership, legitimizing colonization of “unused” land.  
- [[02_People or Entities/Emer de Vattel\|Emer de Vattel]] later codified the right of “cultivated nations” to claim uninhabited or “undeveloped” territories.  
- [[02_People or Entities/Samuel Pufendorf\|Samuel Pufendorf]] attempted to moralize this process by grounding law in sociability, but retained the civilizational hierarchy.  
- The Enlightenment inherited Grotius’s paradox: moral law without global equality.

- Expands into [[04_Comparative or Integrated Notes/Locke - Property and Empire\|Locke - Property and Empire]] on economic justification.  
- Critiqued in [[Colonialism and the Law of Nations\|Colonialism and the Law of Nations]] and modern postcolonial theory.

## 💬 Reflections or Applications
Grotius dreamed of a rational world order; empires made it real in their own image.  
His law of nations united Europe under reason, while dividing the world through hierarchy.  
This dual legacy survives: international law still oscillates between **universal justice** and **hegemonic power**.  
To understand modern global inequality, one must begin with Grotius — the jurist of humanity and the lawyer of empire.
