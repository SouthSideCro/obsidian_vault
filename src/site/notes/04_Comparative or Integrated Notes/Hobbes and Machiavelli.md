## ðŸ§­ Summary
[[NiccolÃ² Machiavelli\|NiccolÃ² Machiavelli]] and [[02_People or Entities/Thomas Hobbes\|Thomas Hobbes]] stand as the twin founders of modern political realism.  
Both reject moral and theological frameworks in favor of a descriptive, necessity-driven view of politics. Yet their approaches differ in method and purpose: Machiavelli is a historian of power and contingency, while Hobbes is a scientist of order and necessity.  
Together they mark the transition from the Renaissance city-state to the modern sovereign state â€” from virtÃ¹ to Leviathan.

## ðŸ§© Key Points
- **Shared Realist Premises:**  
  - Politics cannot be judged by moral ideals; it must be understood through power, fear, and necessity.  
  - Human beings are motivated by passion and self-interest, not virtue or reason alone.  
  - The purpose of government is survival and stability, not moral perfection.  

- **Machiavelliâ€™s Realism:**  
  - Grounded in historical observation (*[[03_Sources or Texts/The Prince\|The Prince]]*, *[[03_Sources or Texts/Discourses on Livy\|Discourses on Livy]]*).  
  - Emphasizes virtÃ¹ â€” flexibility, courage, and strategic intelligence.  
  - Fortuna symbolizes contingency; politics requires constant adaptation.  
  - Focus: how rulers acquire and maintain power amid shifting circumstances.  

- **Hobbesâ€™s Realism:**  
  - Grounded in scientific reasoning (*[[03_Sources or Texts/Leviathan\|Leviathan]]*).  
  - Fear, not glory, is the foundation of political behavior.  
  - Necessity replaces fortuna: human passions obey natural laws.  
  - Focus: how to build lasting order from universal insecurity.  

- **From VirtÃ¹ to Fear:**  
  - Machiavelliâ€™s virtÃ¹ = active mastery over chance.  
  - Hobbesâ€™s fear = rational submission to necessity.  
  - Both identify self-preservation as the core of political motivation.  
  - The shift reflects the passage from the civic world of Renaissance republics to the war-torn world of 17th-century states.

## ðŸ’¬ Reflections or Applications
Hobbes completes what Machiavelli begins: the emancipation of politics from theology.  
But where Machiavelli sees the prince as an artist navigating contingency, Hobbes constructs a system where reason and fear eliminate it.  
The result is a shift from the virtuoso politician to the impersonal state â€” from cunning to calculation.  
In their contrast lies the birth of the modern political imagination: a world where order no longer depends on God or virtue, but on human design and necessity.
