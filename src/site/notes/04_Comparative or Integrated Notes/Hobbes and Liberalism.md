## 🧭 Summary
The **liberal tradition** arises as both a continuation and critique of [[02_People or Entities/Thomas Hobbes\|Thomas Hobbes]].  
Like Hobbes, liberal thinkers such as [[John Locke\|John Locke]] and [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau\|Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] root political legitimacy in consent rather than divine right.  
Yet where Hobbes sees consent as a *transfer* of rights to an absolute sovereign, the liberals reinterpret it as a *trust* or *participation* — limiting power to preserve individual freedom.  
Thus, Hobbes stands at liberalism’s threshold: the founder of its logic, but not of its spirit.

## 🧩 Key Points

- **Shared Premises with Liberalism:**  
  - Political order is a human construct, not a divine gift.  
  - Legitimate power originates in the consent of the governed.  
  - Individuals are the starting point of political analysis.  

- **Hobbes’s Limits:**  
  - Consent is a one-time, irrevocable act of submission.  
  - Sovereignty is indivisible and absolute.  
  - Rights exist only through law; there are no pre-political rights.  
  - Freedom = absence of external constraint, not participation or autonomy.  

- **Locke’s Liberal Revision:**  
  - Retains the state of nature but makes it moral and lawful.  
  - Introduces natural rights (life, liberty, property) that pre-exist the state.  
  - Government is fiduciary — power can be revoked if it violates trust.  
  - Replaces fear with reasoned self-interest and moral equality.  

- **Rousseau’s Radical Transformation:**  
  - Redefines the social contract as *collective sovereignty* — the general will.  
  - Freedom regained through participation in making the laws.  
  - Contradicts Hobbes’s submission with civic autonomy.  

- **Conceptual Comparison:**

| Concept | Hobbes | Locke | Rousseau |
|:--|:--|:--|:--|
| **State of Nature** | War and fear | Peaceful, rational, but insecure | Innocent and equal |
| **Origin of Society** | Fear of death | Protection of rights | Moral and civic freedom |
| **Nature of Contract** | Absolute submission | Conditional trust | Collective self-rule |
| **Sovereignty** | Undivided and absolute | Limited and accountable | Popular and participatory |
| **Freedom** | Absence of constraint | Protection of rights | Participation in will |
| **Purpose of Government** | Security and order | Preservation of rights | Expression of general will |

## 💬 Reflections or Applications
Liberalism inherits Hobbes’s architecture but rejects his psychology.  
It keeps consent but denies absolute power; it keeps equality but replaces fear with rights.  
Hobbes thus becomes the “dark mirror” of liberalism — its necessary ancestor and perpetual warning.  
Every liberal constitution, in seeking to balance freedom and security, reenacts the Hobbesian dilemma: how to trust power without surrendering to it.
