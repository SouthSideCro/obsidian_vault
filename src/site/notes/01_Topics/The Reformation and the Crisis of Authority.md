## üß≠ Summary
The Protestant Reformation shattered the religious unity that had underpinned medieval political order. For thinkers like [[Jean Bodin\|Jean Bodin]]‚Äîand later [[02_People or Entities/Thomas Hobbes\|Thomas Hobbes]]‚Äîthis rupture made the question of legitimate authority urgent. [[Alan Ryan\|Alan Ryan]] stresses that the Reformation‚Äôs theological revolutions, especially those of [[Martin Luther\|Martin Luther]] and [[John Calvin\|John Calvin]], unintentionally transferred power from the Church to secular rulers, laying the groundwork for the modern doctrine of sovereignty.

## üß© Key Points
- **Collapse of Religious Unity:**  
  - Medieval politics rested on a single Church mediating between God and ruler.  
  - Luther and Calvin dismantled this mediation by returning to scripture and conscience.  

- **Martin Luther (1483‚Äì1546):**  
  - *Sola fide* (‚Äúfaith alone‚Äù): salvation depends on faith, not works.  
  - *Sola scriptura* (‚Äúscripture alone‚Äù): authority lies in scripture, not Church hierarchy.  
  - *Priesthood of all believers*: every Christian may interpret scripture.  
  - Political outcome: secular rulers gain authority over religion in their territories through the ‚Äútwo kingdoms‚Äù doctrine.  
  - Unintended effect: transfer of legitimacy from universal Church ‚Üí territorial princes.  

- **John Calvin (1509‚Äì1564):**  
  - Emphasized God‚Äôs sovereignty and predestination.  
  - Built Geneva as a disciplined community of believers.  
  - Allowed conditional obedience: rulers must serve God‚Äôs law, otherwise subjects may resist through magistrates.  
  - Political danger: authority becomes unstable if everyone can claim divine warrant for rebellion.  

- **Historical Background:**  
  - 1517: Luther‚Äôs 95 Theses launch reform.  
  - Within a decade, much of northern Europe embraces his movement.  
  - Calvin‚Äôs influence spreads to France, Scotland, the Netherlands, and beyond.  

## üîó Connections
- Paves the way for [[Jean Bodin\|Jean Bodin]]‚Äôs development of [[01_Topics/Sovereignty\|Sovereignty]] as the principle of unified authority.  
- Sets the historical backdrop for [[02_People or Entities/Thomas Hobbes\|Thomas Hobbes]], who seeks to restore order through an absolute state rather than religion.  
- Connects backward to the collapse of [[Christendom\|Christendom]] and forward to the consolidation of the [[Modern State\|Modern State]].  
- Illustrates the early stages of the [[Transfer of Authority to the State\|Transfer of Authority to the State]] that defines modern political philosophy.

## üí¨ Reflections or Applications
The Reformation unintentionally created the political problem of modernity: how to ground obedience once religious unity is gone. By relocating authority from Church to ruler, it prepared the intellectual space for secular theories of sovereignty and social order. This crisis of legitimacy becomes the starting point for both Bodin and Hobbes‚Äîwhere politics must find new foundations independent of divine mediation.
