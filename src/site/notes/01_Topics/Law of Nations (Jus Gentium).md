## 🧭 Summary
**Jus Gentium**, the *Law of Nations*, is the centerpiece of [[02_People or Entities/Hugo Grotius\|Hugo Grotius]]’s vision of a rational global order.  
It describes the system of rights and duties that bind sovereign states as members of a moral community governed by natural law.  
Emerging from *[[De Jure Belli ac Pacis (1625)\|De Jure Belli ac Pacis (1625)]]*, it transformed war, diplomacy, and trade into matters of law — not divine favor or sheer power.  
Here, Grotius founds the first secular conception of international law.

## 🧩 Key Points

### 🌍 From Natural Law to the Law of Nations
- **Natural law** binds individuals by reason and sociability.  
- **Law of nations** extends those principles to states as collective moral agents.  
- Sovereigns, like individuals, are bound to honor agreements, respect property, and observe justice.  
- States thus form a *society of nations*, replacing the old unity of Christendom with rational order.

---

### ⚖️ Foundations of International Law
- **Equality of Sovereigns:** all states, regardless of size or power, share the same juridical status.  
- **Pacta Sunt Servanda:** treaties must be kept — the cornerstone of mutual trust.  
- **Non-Intervention:** each state has internal autonomy; others must not interfere.  
- **War and Peace as Legal States:** war is no longer a rupture of law but a mode within law.  
- **Common Property:** resources like the seas (*res communis*) belong to all humanity.  

---

### 🧭 Westphalian Transformation
Grotius’s ideas prefigured the **Treaty of Westphalia (1648)**:
- Replacing empire and papal hierarchy with a horizontal order of equal states.  
- Distinguishing **internal sovereignty** (domestic authority) from **external sovereignty** (independence).  
- Creating a pluralist world order united by treaties, diplomacy, and balance of power.  

---

### 💡 Historical and Ethical Ambiguity
Grotius’s law of nations is both **universalist and imperial**:
- Universal because it applies to all peoples by reason.  
- Imperial because it was written from within European colonial expansion.  
His system legitimized European maritime dominance and trade wars under the rhetoric of “freedom of the seas.”

## 🔗 Connections
- Evolves naturally from [[01_Topics/Modern Natural Law (MNL)\|Modern Natural Law (MNL)]], extending rational universality to state relations.  
- Institutionalized through [[Pacta Sunt Servanda (Treaty Obligation)\|Pacta Sunt Servanda (Treaty Obligation)]].  
- Embodied in the [[01_Topics/Sovereignty - Internal vs External\|Sovereignty - Internal vs External]] distinction formalized at Westphalia.  
- Anticipates [[02_People or Entities/Emer de Vattel\|Emer de Vattel]]’s *Law of Nations (1758)*, which codifies these principles.  
- Critiqued in [[04_Comparative or Integrated Notes/Empire - Colonization and International Law\|Empire - Colonization and International Law]] for masking imperial inequalities under a universal law.

## 💬 Reflections or Applications
Grotius’s *jus gentium* marks the birth of the modern international order — an attempt to bind sovereign states by reason, not faith.  
It is the origin of diplomacy, treaty law, and the concept of international justice.  
But it also reveals the paradox of modernity: law universalizes power as easily as it restrains it.  
From Westphalia to the United Nations, the “Grotian tradition” remains alive — a fragile hope that law can humanize sovereignty without erasing it.
