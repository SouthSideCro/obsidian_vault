## üß≠ Summary
**Political realism** is the study of politics as it actually operates rather than as moral ideals imagine it. It views political life as shaped by necessity, competition, and power, rejecting utopian or ethical interpretations. From Machiavelli‚Äôs ‚Äúeffectual truth‚Äù to modern realist thinkers, this tradition insists that survival and order precede justice or virtue. Realism does not deny morality outright but subordinates it to the logic of political action and self-preservation.

## üß© Key Points
- **Foundational Insight:** Politics must be analyzed through outcomes and constraints, not ideals.  
- **Historical Roots:** [[Niccol√≤ Machiavelli\|Niccol√≤ Machiavelli]] reframed politics as an autonomous sphere governed by *necessit√†* and *virt√π*.  
- **Core Assumptions:**
  - Human beings are driven by ambition, fear, and self-interest.  
  - Political order arises from managing these forces, not eliminating them.  
  - Moral norms cannot fully regulate political conduct.  
- **Modern Extensions:**  
  - [[02_People or Entities/Thomas Hobbes\|Thomas Hobbes]] grounds realism in human psychology and the need for sovereignty.  
  - [[Hans Morgenthau\|Hans Morgenthau]] develops *classical realism* in international relations, defining power as the core of politics.  
  - [[Max Weber\|Max Weber]] and [[Carl Schmitt\|Carl Schmitt]] analyze politics through responsibility, legitimacy, and the friend‚Äìenemy distinction.  
- **Analytical Aim:** To reveal how political actors pursue stability, survival, and influence under conditions of uncertainty and conflict.

## üîó Connections
- Arises as a critique of [[Political Idealism\|Political Idealism]] and moralized humanism.  
- Intersects with [[01_Topics/The Modern State (Lo Stato)\|The Modern State (Lo Stato)]] as both emerge from the logic of necessity.  
- Conceptually linked to [[01_Topics/Virt√π and Fortuna\|Virt√π and Fortuna]] through its focus on human agency and contingency.  
- In international theory, evolves into [[Realpolitik\|Realpolitik]] and later structural realism.  
- Contrasted with normative traditions such as [[Liberalism\|Liberalism]] and [[Republicanism\|Republicanism]].

## üí¨ Reflections or Applications
Political realism exposes the tension between moral aspiration and pragmatic necessity. It remains vital for understanding power politics, statecraft, and policy-making in both domestic and international contexts. By treating politics as a distinct domain with its own logic, realism offers clarity but also invites ethical unease: can governance ever be both moral and effective? This question continues to animate debates from Machiavelli to contemporary geopolitics.
