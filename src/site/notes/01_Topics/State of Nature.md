## üß≠ Summary
The **State of Nature** is the foundational thought experiment of early modern political philosophy ‚Äî a hypothetical pre-political condition used to explain why humans create governments.  
For [[02_People or Entities/Thomas Hobbes\|Thomas Hobbes]], it represents the natural equality and insecurity of all individuals, leading to perpetual fear and conflict. This condition motivates the formation of the [[01_Topics/Social Contract\|Social Contract]], which creates [[01_Topics/Sovereignty\|Sovereignty]] and peace. Later thinkers like [[John Locke\|John Locke]] and [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau\|Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] reimagined the state of nature to support very different political ideals ‚Äî from natural rights to moral freedom.

## üß© Key Points
- **Hobbes‚Äôs Version:**  
  - In *[[03_Sources or Texts/Leviathan\|Leviathan]]*, the state of nature is a state of war ‚Äî not constant fighting, but a constant disposition to it.  
  - Everyone has a right to everything, including one another‚Äôs life.  
  - Equality of power and desire breeds mistrust, competition, and preemptive violence.  
  - Fear of death becomes the rational motive for peace.  

- **Underlying Anthropology:**  
  - Humans are driven by passions: fear, pride, desire for power, and self-preservation.  
  - Reason is instrumental ‚Äî it calculates means to safety, not moral ends.  
  - [[01_Topics/Necessit√† (Necessity)\|Necessit√† (Necessity)]] governs behavior: self-interest and motion are universal laws.  

- **Contrast with Others:**  
  - **Locke:** state of nature is peaceful but insecure; people possess natural rights.  
  - **Rousseau:** state of nature is innocent; society corrupts through inequality.  
  - **Machiavelli:** no explicit ‚Äústate of nature,‚Äù but assumes conflict as natural to politics ‚Äî a proto-realism that Hobbes systematizes.  

- **Philosophical Function:**  
  - Serves as a rational fiction ‚Äî not history, but a model of human motivation.  
  - Justifies political authority as the rational remedy to natural chaos.  
  - Frames sovereignty as an artificial construct born from necessity.  

## üîó Connections
- Immediate precursor to the [[01_Topics/Social Contract\|Social Contract]] in *[[03_Sources or Texts/Leviathan\|Leviathan]]*.  
- Provides the natural condition overcome by [[01_Topics/Sovereignty\|Sovereignty]] and the [[05_Frameworks or Models/Fear‚ÄìOrder‚ÄìSovereignty Framework\|Fear‚ÄìOrder‚ÄìSovereignty Framework]].  
- Rooted in the breakdown of unity in the [[01_Topics/Crisis of Christendom\|Crisis of Christendom]], where divine order no longer guarantees peace.  
- Extends [[02_People or Entities/Machiavelli\|Machiavelli]]‚Äôs realism into an anthropological model of conflict.  
- Anticipates modern theories of human nature in political science and economics.

## üí¨ Reflections or Applications
The state of nature exposes the fragility of human coexistence once divine or customary authority disappears. In Hobbes‚Äôs vision, this is not a romantic prehistory but a mirror held up to civil war ‚Äî a thought experiment that reveals the logic of fear and the necessity of sovereignty. Modern theories of the individual, from liberalism to game theory, still echo Hobbes‚Äôs insight: without a shared power to restrain us, rational beings create the very conditions of their own insecurity.
