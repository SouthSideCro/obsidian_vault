## 🧭 Summary
**Modern Natural Law (MNL)** emerges in the seventeenth century as a new moral and legal foundation for politics after the collapse of religious unity.  
It defines a system of universal norms binding on all rational beings, independent of theology or state authority.  
For [[02_People or Entities/Hugo Grotius\|Hugo Grotius]], this meant that natural law “would remain valid *etsi Deus non daretur*” — *even if God did not exist*.  
That single claim secularized the entire moral order, making **reason**, not revelation, the measure of justice.

## 🧩 Key Points

### ⚖️ The Shift from Divine to Rational Order
- **Medieval View:** law derived from God’s will (theological natural law).  
- **Modern View:** law derives from the rational and sociable nature of humankind.  
- **Grotius’s innovation:** natural law’s validity does not depend on divine command — it exists by necessity of human reason and sociability.

### 💡 Defining Principles
- **Universality:** applies to all humans by virtue of reason.  
- **Autonomy:** independent from both Church and state.  
- **Priority:** superior to all positive (state-made) laws.  
- **Discoverability:** known by rational reflection on human nature and social life.  

### 🌍 Human Sociability (socialitas)
Grotius grounds obligation in the fact that humans are naturally inclined to live in society.  
Laws arise from this sociability — a mutual recognition of justice, property, and peace.  
This anticipates later Enlightenment moral philosophy (Pufendorf’s *socialitas*, Locke’s *reason*, Kant’s *moral law*).

## 🧩 Grotius vs. Hobbes
- **Grotius:** natural law binds even without a sovereign — it expresses reason’s intrinsic authority.  
- **Hobbes:** natural law obliges only in conscience until enforced by sovereignty.  
- **Continuity:** both detach law from theology, but Hobbes radicalizes it into realism; Grotius remains moral–juridical.

## 💬 Reflections or Applications
Grotius’s move from divine command to rational obligation marks the *birth of modern moral autonomy*.  
It secularizes law but retains universality — a paradox that still shapes human rights discourse.  
From this foundation, modern thought divides: one branch (Hobbes) finds order only in coercion; another (Grotius, Pufendorf, Locke) trusts reason and sociability to guide moral law.  
MNL thus becomes the grammar of the modern world — the attempt to bind power through reason rather than revelation.
