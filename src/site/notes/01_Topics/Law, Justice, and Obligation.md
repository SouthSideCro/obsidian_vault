## 🧭 Summary
For [[02_People or Entities/Thomas Hobbes\|Thomas Hobbes]], **law**, **justice**, and **obligation** are not moral ideals but the consequences of the [[01_Topics/Social Contract\|Social Contract]] that creates [[01_Topics/Sovereignty\|Sovereignty]].  
Before the covenant, in the [[01_Topics/State of Nature\|State of Nature]], there is no law and therefore no injustice — only liberty and fear.  
Once the contract is formed, justice becomes obedience to law; moral obligation is redefined as political duty.  
This transformation marks Hobbes’s radical break with classical and Christian conceptions of law as a reflection of natural or divine order.

## 🧩 Key Points

- **Law as Command:**  
  - Law is “the command of the sovereign.”  
  - It derives from will, not from natural or divine reason.  
  - Without a sovereign, “law” is merely counsel or custom, not binding rule.  

- **Justice as Obedience:**  
  - Justice = keeping covenants.  
  - In the state of nature, where no power enforces contracts, justice is impossible.  
  - Once law exists, justice consists in obedience to that law — not in moral virtue.  

- **Obligation and Fear:**  
  - Obligation arises from consent and the fear of punishment.  
  - Fear that compels obedience is rational — it preserves life and order.  
  - Political duty thus rests on necessity, not conscience.

## 🔗 Connections
- Defines the ethical logic of [[01_Topics/Sovereignty\|Sovereignty]] in *[[03_Sources or Texts/Leviathan\|Leviathan]]*.  
- Completes the transition from [[01_Topics/Necessità (Necessity)\|Necessità (Necessity)]] (natural compulsion) to civil law (political obligation).  
- Integral to the [[05_Frameworks or Models/Fear–Order–Sovereignty Framework\|Fear–Order–Sovereignty Framework]]: fear legitimates law by making obedience rational.  
- Responds to the moral collapse after the [[01_Topics/Crisis of Christendom\|Crisis of Christendom]] — replaces divine law with human convention.  
- Anticipates later contrasts with [[John Locke\|John Locke]]’s natural rights and [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau\|Jean-Jacques Rousseau]]’s general will.

## 💬 Reflections or Applications
Hobbes redefines justice and duty in purely political terms: law becomes the architecture of fear, and obedience its rational expression.  
Where classical philosophy sought harmony with natural law, Hobbes builds security through artificial power.  
The result is a world where justice is no longer eternal but contingent — an achievement of will, not of wisdom.  
In modern politics, every legal system still bears this Hobbesian tension between consent and coercion, obedience and freedom.
