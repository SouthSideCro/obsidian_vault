## 🧭 Summary
**[[01_Topics/Jus ad Bellum (Just Causes of War)\|Jus ad Bellum (Just Causes of War)]]** — “the right to war” — defines the legitimate reasons a state or actor may resort to armed conflict.  
In *[[De Jure Belli ac Pacis (1625)\|De Jure Belli ac Pacis (1625)]]*, [[02_People or Entities/Hugo Grotius\|Hugo Grotius]] codifies this as part of his broader project to **rationalize and civilize warfare**.  
Where medieval just war theory had been grounded in theology, Grotius builds a secular framework: war is permissible only under conditions that reason and justice can recognize.

## 🧩 Key Points

### ⚖️ Legitimate Causes of War
Grotius distinguishes between **just** and **unjust** wars:
- **Self-defense:** the clearest and most universally accepted cause.  
- **Restoration of property or rights:** recovering what has been wrongfully taken.  
- **Punishment for wrongdoing:** enforcing justice when no higher authority exists.  

He rejects wars of conversion, expansion, or revenge — these violate natural law’s demand for proportionality and right intention.

### 💡 Criteria for a Just War
| Criterion | Definition | Grotius’s Emphasis |
|:--|:--|:--|
| **Just Cause** | Defensive or restorative; redress of injury. | War as a legal act of justice, not ambition. |
| **Legitimate Authority** | Must be declared by a sovereign power. | Reflects the emerging state system. |
| **Right Intention** | Aim at peace and order, not vengeance. | Moral restraint within necessity. |
| **Last Resort** | All peaceful options must be exhausted. | Rational rather than impulsive action. |
| **Proportionality** | Harm caused must not exceed the wrong suffered. | Forbids annihilation or cruelty. |
| **Probability of Success** | War must not be futile. | Imposes pragmatic moral calculus. |

### ⚔️ Between Morality and Realism
Grotius walks a delicate line:
- Unlike **[[Erasmus of Rotterdam\|Erasmus of Rotterdam]]**, he does not condemn all wars as sinful.  
- Unlike **[[02_People or Entities/Machiavelli\|Machiavelli]]**, he does not treat war as morally neutral.  
- Instead, he argues that war must serve justice, not passion or profit.  
This transforms warfare from divine judgment into a legal question — a matter of **rational adjudication** between states.

### 🌍 From Theological to Juridical Order
The shift from “holy war” to “just war” expresses the broader transformation of European politics:
- Legitimacy now rests on **reason, [[01_Topics/Sovereignty\|Sovereignty]], and [[01_Topics/Modern Natural Law (MNL)\|Modern Natural Law (MNL)]]**, not on papal sanction.  
- War becomes a continuation of law, not its suspension.  
- The emerging **Westphalian system** institutionalizes this legal framing of conflict.

## 💬 Reflections or Applications
Grotius’s *jus ad bellum* remains the cornerstone of modern international ethics.  
By rooting war in law, he transforms violence into something that can be judged — and therefore limited.  
Yet this same logic enabled imperial states to claim justice in their conquests.  
Every “just war” since — from colonial ventures to humanitarian interventions — still lives in Grotius’s shadow, where moral principle and political interest are never fully separable.
