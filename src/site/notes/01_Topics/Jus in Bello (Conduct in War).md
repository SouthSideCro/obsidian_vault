## 🧭 Summary
**Jus in bello** — “justice in war” — defines the moral and legal rules that govern conduct during warfare.  
In *[[De Jure Belli ac Pacis (1625)\|De Jure Belli ac Pacis (1625)]]*, [[02_People or Entities/Hugo Grotius\|Hugo Grotius]] argues that even in the chaos of war, human reason imposes limits.  
Combat does not suspend law; rather, law civilizes combat.  
This became the foundation for later humanitarian law and the moral principle that **not all means are justified by victory**.

## 🧩 Key Points

### ⚖️ Core Principles
- **Distinction:** combatants may be targeted; noncombatants (civilians, clergy, children) must be spared.  
- **Proportionality:** force must not exceed what is necessary for victory.  
- **Humanity:** no killing of prisoners or surrendered enemies.  
- **Prohibition of cruelty:** torture, mutilation, and destruction for its own sake violate reason and justice.  
- **Protection of property:** plunder must be limited to what necessity demands.  

These principles define a moral code of warfare — not divine commandments, but rational duties derived from human sociability and justice.

### 💡 Rational Morality vs. Realpolitik
Grotius sought to prove that war need not dissolve morality.  
Unlike Machiavelli, who saw war as a realm of necessity beyond ethics, Grotius insists that **law follows the soldier** — even into battle.  
This vision of war as a regulated contest between sovereigns anticipates the **laws of armed conflict** codified centuries later.

---

### 🕊️ Humanitarian Implications
Grotius’s *jus in bello* became the ancestor of:
- The **Geneva Conventions** (1864–1949) — rules protecting civilians and prisoners.  
- The **Hague Conventions** (1899, 1907) — laws on conduct, weapons, and treatment of enemies.  
- The **UN Charter** — upholding the principle that even in war, sovereignty does not exempt moral responsibility.  

His central idea: **“even enemies share a common humanity.”**

### ⚔️ Tension and Contradiction
Despite its moral ambition, Grotius’s system was used by colonial powers to claim legitimacy for “civilized” warfare while waging brutal campaigns abroad.  
By distinguishing “just” from “unjust” conduct, European empires portrayed their wars of conquest as morally regulated — a pattern that endures in the rhetoric of “intervention” and “humanitarian war.”

## 💬 Reflections or Applications
Grotius’s *jus in bello* is the moral grammar of modern war — restraint amid destruction.  
It affirms that reason and humanity survive even when law falters.  
Yet its very universality masks power: the claim to fight “justly” often accompanies domination.  
Every rule of civilized war, from the seventeenth century to today, carries the double legacy of Grotius — *law as both shield and sword*.
