## 🧭 Summary
*Leviathan, or The Matter, Forme, and Power of a Commonwealth Ecclesiasticall and Civil* (1651) is [[02_People or Entities/Thomas Hobbes\|Thomas Hobbes]]’s masterpiece — a unified theory of human nature, society, and political order.  
Written during the English Civil War, it sought to restore peace through a rational foundation for absolute authority. Hobbes argues that political order arises from fear of death and the rational recognition that only a common power — the sovereign — can secure peace. The *Leviathan* is thus an “artificial man,” a state created by contract to protect its creators from themselves.

## 🧩 Key Points
- **Structure:**  
  - *Part I*: Human Nature — the passions, desires, and aversions that govern behavior.  
  - *Part II*: The Commonwealth — the creation of the sovereign through the *[[01_Topics/Social Contract\|Social Contract]]*.  
  - *Part III*: Religion — critique of ecclesiastical power.  
  - *Part IV*: The Kingdom of Darkness — polemic against superstition and divided authority.  

- **State of Nature:**  
  - Humans are equal in vulnerability and ambition; lacking authority, they live in a state of war.  
  - Life without government is “solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and short.”  
  - Fear of violent death drives the search for peace.  

- **Social Contract:**  
  - Individuals covenant to transfer their right of self-defense to a sovereign.  
  - This act creates a collective person — the *Leviathan* — endowed with absolute authority.  
  - The sovereign cannot be unjust, for justice is defined by his laws.  

- **Sovereignty:**  
  - Absolute, indivisible, and necessary for order.  
  - Divided authority leads to civil war and collapse.  
  - The sovereign represents the people; rebellion dissolves the social contract itself.  

- **Religion and Politics:**  
  - Rejects papal or clerical supremacy; religion must submit to civil power.  
  - Theological disputes are political dangers, not spiritual truths.  
  - Restores peace by subordinating conscience to law.  

- **Scientific Method:**  
  - Modeled after geometry and physics — deduction from first principles.  
  - Seeks a “political science” based on cause and effect, not moral ideals.

## 💬 Reflections or Applications
*Leviathan* marks the decisive transformation of political thought from moral theology to political science. Hobbes’s sovereign embodies the logic of fear and necessity — an artificial unity designed to save humans from their natural condition. Yet the work also reveals the paradox of modern politics: the very power created to protect us also defines our subjection. The *Leviathan* thus remains the founding myth of the modern state — both protector and monster, the price of peace in a world without divine order.
